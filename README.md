# visual-rhetoric-prompt
Assignment prompts and deadlines for unit on visual rhetoric

Your task in this unit is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to capture images and arrange them using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, inviting someone inside, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.

As you start planning your composition, consider: What ideas do *you* want help remembering? Or what do you want to persuade others of? Is there something you've noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others? See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

## Generative constraints

We can revisit these after we get into the midst of composing, but to get you started:

* Include at least two images from separate sources.
* Include at least one word, with a carefully chosen font.
* Include at least one image or photograph produced (e.g. taken or drawn) by you.
* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
* Aim for surprise or metaphorical leap in the elements you bring together.
