Women In Tech Visual Rhetoric  

For my project I decided to make my argument about women in technology. There are a lot of famous men that are known  
in the field of technology such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs etc. However, many very influential people  
in the evolution of technology have been female. In this rhetoric I wanted to draw attention to these very influential  
women to recognize them as well as let people especially young women see that women are highly capable in the technology   
field as it has become very male dominated and stereotypes have formed. In this preview (WomenInTech.png) I chose images  
of some of the most influential women in tech and arranged them in a pyramid type stance. I want to make the arrangement  
of the women very powerful. Right now, I arranged them somewhat randomly but I think I may rearrange it, so the center   
focus is on the oldest women I have chosen, to represent that each generation of technologist have led to the next.   
I also would like to choose someone else to put on the left I think visually having such a recent technologist throws   
off the rhetoric and would prefer to stick to historical women. There are some women who were so influential so early on  
that the only photos are black and white or there aren’t even photos only paintings. I would like to stick to color   
photos for now. I also had some issues finding another historical woman who’s photo I could use ethically but I am going  
to keep looking for a different picture. Another Idea I have is to add some phrases that tell more about the women such  
as “queen of code” or “first women to…” and include some of their accomplishments. I think that upon first look people   
probably won’t recognize these women, however they should. In order to help the viewer understand the message I think   
some phrases will help them to see the argument.
