Assets for Women in Technology Visual Rhetoric  
Images of women in technology - I believe this will primarily need to be taken by myself. I can take these photographs at a WICS meeting.  
or if I can ethically find them I will use images of Katherine Johnson, Grace Hopper, Anita Borg etc.  
Text - I will likely use Font Squirrel for fonts and text
